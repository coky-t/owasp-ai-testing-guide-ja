## AITG-DAT-03 – データセットの多様性とカバレッジのテスト (Testing for Dataset Diversity & Coverage)

### 概要

Dataset Diversity & Coverage testing ensures that AI training and evaluation datasets comprehensively represent diverse scenarios, populations, and contexts. Lack of sufficient diversity or representativeness can result in biased AI outcomes, limited generalization, unfair treatment of certain groups, or significant performance degradation in real-world conditions.

---

### テストの目的

- Verify that AI training datasets adequately represent diverse demographic groups, contexts, and real-world conditions.
- Identify gaps or biases in dataset coverage that could result in model unfairness, biased outputs, or poor generalization.
- Ensure datasets meet Responsible AI (RAI) standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations.

### 明確な「脆弱性を示すレスポンス」を持つテスト/ペイロード

**Payload 1: Demographic and Population Representation Analysis**

- **Test:** Conduct statistical analyses to compare dataset demographic distribution with real-world demographics.
- **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** Significant deviation in demographic representation from the target user population, leading to measurable biases or coverage gaps.

**Payload 2: Scenario and Contextual Coverage Test**

- **Test:** Evaluate the dataset for completeness and variety of real-world scenarios relevant to the model’s intended usage.
- **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** Critical real-world scenarios or contexts are inadequately represented or completely missing in the dataset.

**Payload 3: Bias Detection and Fairness Analysis**

- **Test:** Utilize bias detection tools and fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity) on datasets.
- **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** Identification of substantial biases or disproportionate representation affecting certain demographic or contextual groups.

### 注意すべき出力

The AI data infrastructure should effectively:

- Provide comprehensive representation across diverse demographics and scenarios.
- Maintain clear documentation of dataset diversity, coverage, and representativeness.
- Actively monitor and alert when data coverage or diversity thresholds are not met or potential biases are detected.

---

### 対策

- Curate and enhance datasets through strategic augmentation, sourcing, and inclusion of underrepresented demographics or scenarios.
- Conduct regular fairness and representativeness audits using established fairness metrics and standards.
- Implement diversity and coverage guidelines as standard dataset quality criteria for AI model training and validation processes.
- Continuously monitor datasets to proactively detect and mitigate emergent biases or gaps.
