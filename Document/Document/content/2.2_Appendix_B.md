## 2.2 付録 B: 分散型、不変的、一時的 (DIE) 脅威の特定 (Appendix B: Distributed, Immutable, Ephemeral (DIE) Threat Identification)

AI models operate at massive scale, rely on highly dynamic data flows, and often function as opaque “black boxes,” which can introduce unexpected failure modes and attack surfaces. To address this, the DIE Triad, Distributed, Immutable, Ephemeral offers a complementary, resilience-focused framework. Originally proposed by Sounil Yu \[20\], the DIE model shifts the focus from traditional data protection toward system survivability, adaptability, and architectural robustness. In AI contexts, where model drift, adversarial inputs, and dependency chains are constant concerns, applying the DIE principles helps ensure that AI systems are not only secure, but also resilient by design, capable of withstanding disruption and degradation. 

While CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) focuses on protecting data and systems from unauthorized access and disruption, DIE shifts the focus to reducing the value and longevity of attack targets through design principles that emphasize:

1. **Distributed – Systems should not rely on single points of failure.** Workloads, data, and services are spread across nodes to ensure resilience, scalability, and fault tolerance.

2. **Immutable – Components, especially code and data, should not be modified after deployment.** This limits tampering, simplifies rollback, and ensures auditability and predictability.

3. **Ephemeral – Systems should be short-lived by design.** Containers, functions, sessions, and data should expire quickly, reducing attack windows and minimizing exposure in case of compromise.

Where CIA is about protecting data, DIE is about designing systems that are inherently resistant to compromise, even if breached. Together, CIA and DIE provide a complementary security and resilience strategy, particularly important in AI, serverless, and microservices environments.  Where CIA is excellent for defining *security objectives* like preventing unauthorized access or ensuring uptime, DIE focuses on *architectural resilience and trustworthiness*, especially important for: Cloud-native AI systems, LLM agents and plugin architectures and Federated learning and edge AI. 

Many modern AI system failures (e.g., data remnants in shared GPUs, hot-reloaded LLM agents, or drift in distributed pipelines, are violations of DIE principles, not just CIA.)

Below is a structured explanation showing how DIE (Distributed, Immutable, Ephemeral) threats differ from and complement the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) model specifically in the context of AI systems aligned to the SAIF (Secure AI Framework) architecture.

| DIE vs CIA in SAIF-Aligned AI Architectures |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **SAIF Layer** | **DIE Property** | **Example DIE Threat** | **Why It’s Not Fully Covered by CIA** |
| Infrastructure | Ephemeral | Data residue in serverless inference functions | CIA assumes static data protection, but doesn’t assess whether environments are truly short-lived. |
| Infrastructure | Immutable | Improper model immutability in CI/CD pipelines | CIA covers unauthorized changes but not immutability guarantees for reproducibility and rollback. |
| Data | Distributed | Loss of data provenance in federated training | CIA protects data in motion/rest but not consistency or lineage in distributed environments. |
| Model | Immutable | Self-modifying inference logic | CIA may flag unauthorized updates but not dynamic, internal logic changes (e.g., prompt tuning). |
| Application | Ephemeral | Persistent caching in chatbots or RAG systems | CIA addresses data exposure but not requirements for automatic expiration or zero-trace design. |
| Infrastructure | Distributed | Inconsistent access policies across multi-cloud deployments | CIA checks policy presence but not synchronization or enforcement across distributed systems. |

Here is the completed DIE (Distributed, Immutable, Ephemeral) threat mapping for SAIF components \#1–\#18.
