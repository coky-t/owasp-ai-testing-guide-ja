## AITG-DAT-05 – データ最小化と同意のテスト (Testing for Data Minimization & Consent)

### 概要

Testing for Data Minimization & Consent involves assessing whether AI systems adhere strictly to privacy principles, particularly the minimization of data collection and processing, as well as ensuring explicit consent has been obtained from users. It focuses on verifying compliance with data protection regulations (such as GDPR, HIPAA) and ethical guidelines, preventing unnecessary or unauthorized processing of personal and sensitive information.

### テストの目的

- Ensure AI systems only collect, process, and retain data that is strictly necessary for defined purposes.
- Verify that proper consent mechanisms are implemented, recorded, and auditable.
- Detect and prevent potential overreach or unnecessary data usage that could violate privacy and ethical standards.

### テスト方法/ペイロード

**Payload 1: Excessive Data Request**

- **Test:** Submit data requests to the system that include fields beyond the scope of the stated purpose.
- **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** System accepts, processes, and stores unnecessary personal or sensitive data without restrictions.

**Payload 2: Consent Handling Audit**

- **Test:** Verify consent mechanisms by simulating consent withdrawal or refusal scenarios.
- **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** System continues processing personal data even after consent withdrawal, or lacks effective mechanisms to manage consent status.

**Payload 3: Data Retention Test**

- **Test:** Evaluate data retention policies by attempting to access or retrieve user data that should have been anonymized, deleted, or expired according to stated policy.
- **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** Data remains accessible or retrievable after expiration of its designated retention period.

### 期待される出力

The AI data infrastructure should effectively:
- **Enforce Data Minimization**: The backend should strictly validate incoming data against a defined schema and reject or ignore any fields not explicitly required for the stated purpose.
- **Maintain Auditable Consent Records**: The system must maintain a clear, demonstrable, and timestamped record of when a user grants and withdraws consent.
- **Honor Consent Status**: Data processing jobs must check for valid, active consent for each user before execution. If consent is withdrawn, all non-essential processing must cease immediately.
- **Automate Data Retention**: The system must have automated processes that enforce data retention policies by deleting or anonymizing data after a specified period.

### 対策

- **Implement Schema Validation on Ingest**: All data collection endpoints (APIs, forms) must validate incoming data against a strict schema. Any fields not in the schema should be rejected or silently dropped, never stored.
- **Adopt a Consent Management Platform (CMP)**: Implement a robust, centralized CMP to manage the entire lifecycle of user consent. This platform should provide an audit trail and serve as the single source of truth for consent status.
- **Enforce Consent Checks in Processing Logic**: Every data processing task that relies on consent must begin with a check against the CMP. If consent is not present or has been withdrawn, the task must terminate.
- **Automate Data Retention and Deletion**: Implement automated scripts or database policies (e.g., TTL - Time To Live) that periodically scan for and permanently delete or anonymize data that has exceeded its retention period.
- **Provide a User Privacy Dashboard**: Give users a clear, accessible interface to view what data is stored about them, understand how it is used, and easily grant or withdraw consent at any time.
