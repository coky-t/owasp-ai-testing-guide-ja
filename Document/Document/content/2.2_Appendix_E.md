# 2.2 付録 E: SAIF AI 脅威の標的コンポーネントと CVE/CWE (Appendix E: SAIF AI Threat Targeted Components & CVEs/CWEs)

The purpose of this appendix is to provide pen testers with a detailed tech stack of the targeted SAIF component and sub-components of the AI architecture, whether it be user inputs, the model layer, supporting infrastructure, or data sources and CVEs/CWEs that can be exploited by the AI threats targeting these components and sub-components. During test scoping, the tester determines which components and sub-components of the AI application are in scope for testing. For example, user input through a Slack bot connected to a FastAPI backend may be included, while certain external APIs might be excluded. The tester then can cross-reference the **Tech Stack** column of the mapping table to understand exactly which frameworks and services are deployed, such as FastAPI, Redis, or Pinecone, and uses this knowledge to conduct specific tech-stack aware pen tests. This is a step by step process.

The first step is **Threat enumeration and CVE exploit path mapping**. The CVE column provides known vulnerabilities that can be validated with scanners (like Nessus or Nuclei) or manual proof-of-concept scripts. For instance, Redis in the data storage layer may expose `CVE-2022-0543` (Lua sandbox escape), which could be exploited to poison embeddings and trigger runtime data poisoning (`T01-RMP`). Similarly, an outdated Confluence instance may expose `CVE-2021-22911`, leading to sensitive information disclosure (`T01-SID`) if training data leaks from a knowledge base. By tying each CVE to an AI-specific threat, the pen tester demonstrates not only a technical flaw but also its effect on model behavior and trustworthiness.

Once vulnerabilities are identified, they are mapped to AI-specific threats using the **AI Threats** column. This is where the table delivers unique value: it bridges traditional software flaws with AI-centric risks. For example, FastAPI sanitization weaknesses (`CVE-2022-36067`) might appear to be routine web vulnerabilities, but in the context of an LLM they translate to `T01-DPJI` (direct prompt injection). Similarly, weaknesses in an Airflow ETL pipeline (`CVE-2022-40127`) could be exploited not just for remote code execution but for `T01-DMP` (data poisoning), corrupting training or retrieval data. This mapping ensures testers move beyond “server RCE” reports and instead demonstrate AI model compromise impacts.

With this foundation, the tester moves into a **systematic execution strategy**. For each SAIF component, they review the subcomponents to see where injection, poisoning, or manipulation is possible. They verify which technologies are actually deployed and run tests to identify CVEs that can be exploited due to vulnerable and un-patched libraries/components. They then simulate attack driven tests for AI-specific threats such as prompt injection, model inversion, membership inference, poisoning attacks, or runtime denial of service. For example, in the case of data storage infrastructure (SAIF component 15), a vulnerable CVE in Weaviate instance could be targeted. A known plugin path traversal vulnerability (`CVE-2023-41267`) may allow the attacker to inject poisoned vector entries, resulting in `T01-RMP` runtime data poisoning where the chatbot retrieves manipulated facts.

Reporting leverages the table’s structure to maintain **traceability**. A finding might read: “Redis vulnerable to `CVE-2022-0543`,” which maps to `CWE-94` (code injection) and aligns with AI Threat `T01-RMP` (runtime data poisoning). The impact statement would explain that this weakness allows the chatbot to output attacker-controlled responses. This creates a clear chain from vulnerability to exploit to AI-specific risk, making the report resonate with both security engineers and AI/ML practitioners.

The second step is to conduct a **Threat enumeration and CWE exploit path mapping**. The CWE-based table adds another layer by framing these vulnerabilities/findings as **design weaknesses**, not just CVEs that need patching. For example, `CWE-20` (improper input validation) points to weak parsing logic, `CWE-276` (incorrect default permissions) highlights misconfigurations in data storage or S3 buckets, and `CWE-345` (insufficient verification of data authenticity) shows systemic flaws in RAG ingestion. 

Finally, the third step is to look at **AI Threats, Targeted CWEs and Provide Recommendations to Fix Them** in the Pen Testing Report. CWEs being targeted by a threat needs to be accompanied by secure design recommendations, such as enforcing schema validation, disabling default public access, verifying dataset authenticity, or encrypting sensitive data. This means pen testers can move from “here is how I broke it” to “here is how you should redesign it to prevent recurrence.”

As pen testers revisit systems, they can update the CVE and CWE of newly discovered vulnerabilities and use the AI Threats column as a checklist for attack simulations in future red-team exercises. Over time, this evolving matrix becomes a living test harness — a fusion of exploit paths, systemic weaknesses, AI threats, and design-level fixes — that supports secure design, ongoing validation, and resilience in AI-enabled systems.
