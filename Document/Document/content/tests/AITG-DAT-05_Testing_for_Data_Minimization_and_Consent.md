## AITG-DAT-05 – データ最小化と同意のテスト (Testing for Data Minimization & Consent)

### 概要

Testing for Data Minimization & Consent involves assessing whether AI systems adhere strictly to privacy principles, particularly the minimization of data collection and processing, as well as ensuring explicit consent has been obtained from users. It focuses on verifying compliance with data protection regulations (such as GDPR, HIPAA) and ethical guidelines, preventing unnecessary or unauthorized processing of personal and sensitive information.

### テストの目的

- Ensure AI systems only collect, process, and retain data that is strictly necessary for defined purposes.
- Verify that proper consent mechanisms are implemented, recorded, and auditable.
- Detect and prevent potential overreach or unnecessary data usage that could violate privacy and ethical standards.

### 明確な「脆弱性を示すレスポンス」を持つテスト/ペイロード

**Payload 1: Excessive Data Request**

- **Test:** Submit data requests to the system that include fields beyond the scope of the stated purpose.
- **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** System accepts, processes, and stores unnecessary personal or sensitive data without restrictions.

**Payload 2: Consent Handling Audit**

- **Test:** Verify consent mechanisms by simulating consent withdrawal or refusal scenarios.
- **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** System continues processing personal data even after consent withdrawal, or lacks effective mechanisms to manage consent status.

**Payload 3: Data Retention Test**

- **Test:** Evaluate data retention policies by attempting to access or retrieve user data that should have been anonymized, deleted, or expired according to stated policy.
- **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** Data remains accessible or retrievable after expiration of its designated retention period.

### 注意すべき出力

The AI data infrastructure should effectively:

- Limit data collection strictly to fields required for explicit, consented purposes.
- Maintain clear, demonstrable consent records and mechanisms for users.
- Automatically enforce and audit data retention, anonymization, and deletion policies.

---

### 対策

- Clearly define and document data collection purposes and adhere strictly to them.
- Implement robust user consent management platforms with explicit audit trails.
- Enforce automated data retention and minimization practices, regularly auditing compliance.
- Provide clear mechanisms and user interfaces for users to manage, view, or withdraw consent easily.
