The **AI Application Testing** category addresses security, safety, and trust risks arising specifically from interactions between AI systems, end-users, and external data sources. This testing category evaluates the behavior of AI applications when processing user inputs, generating outputs, and handling runtime interactions, with the goal of uncovering and mitigating vulnerabilities unique to AI-driven interactions, such as prompt injections, sensitive data leaks, and unsafe or biased outputs.

Given the direct exposure of AI applications to users and external environments, testing at this layer is critical to prevent unauthorized access, manipulation of AI behavior, and compliance violations. The category covers comprehensive evaluation against well-defined threat scenarios, including adversarial prompt manipulation, unsafe outputs, agentic misbehavior, and risks related to model extraction or embedding manipulation.
