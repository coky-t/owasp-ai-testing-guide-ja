# AITG-DAT-03 – データセットの多様性とカバレッジのテスト (Testing for Dataset Diversity & Coverage)

### 概要

Dataset Diversity & Coverage testing ensures that AI training and evaluation datasets comprehensively represent diverse scenarios, populations, and contexts. Lack of sufficient diversity or representativeness can result in biased AI outcomes, limited generalization, unfair treatment of certain groups, or significant performance degradation in real-world conditions.

### テストの目的

- Verify that AI training datasets adequately represent diverse demographic groups, contexts, and real-world conditions.
- Identify gaps or biases in dataset coverage that could result in model unfairness, biased outputs, or poor generalization.
- Ensure datasets meet Responsible AI (RAI) standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations.

### テスト方法/ペイロード

**1. Demographic and Population Representation Analysis**

- Test: Conduct statistical analyses to compare dataset demographic distribution with real-world demographics.
- Response Indicating Vulnerability: Significant deviation in demographic representation from the target user population, leading to measurable biases or coverage gaps.

**2. Scenario and Contextual Coverage Test**

- Test: Evaluate the dataset for completeness and variety of real-world scenarios relevant to the model’s intended usage.
- Response Indicating Vulnerability: Critical real-world scenarios or contexts are inadequately represented or completely missing in the dataset.

**3. Bias Detection and Fairness Analysis**

- Test: Utilize bias detection tools and fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity) on datasets.
- Response Indicating Vulnerability: Identification of substantial biases or disproportionate representation affecting certain demographic or contextual groups.

### 期待される出力

The AI dataset should effectively:
- **Provide Comprehensive Representation**: The distribution of demographic attributes in the dataset should closely mirror the target population. No significant group should constitute less than 5% of the data.
- **Ensure Fairness in Outcomes**: The outcomes present in the dataset (e.g., loan approvals) should not show significant bias. The Demographic Parity Difference should be below 15% for all sensitive attributes.
- **Maintain Clear Documentation**: The dataset should be accompanied by a datasheet or documentation that transparently reports its sources, composition, and known limitations.

### 対策

- **Strategic Data Sourcing and Augmentation**: Actively source data from underrepresented groups and regions. Use data augmentation techniques (e.g., SMOTE for tabular data, back-translation for text) to synthetically increase the representation of minority classes, but do so with caution to avoid introducing unrealistic artifacts.
- **Conduct Regular Fairness Audits**: Implement a continuous integration (CI) process that automatically runs fairness and distribution audits on new training data. Use tools like Fairlearn or AI Fairness 360 to track metrics over time.
- **Implement Bias Mitigation During Pre-processing**: Apply pre-processing techniques to the dataset before training. This can include re-sampling (oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class) or re-weighting data points to balance their influence on the model.
- **Create and Maintain Datasheets**: For every dataset, create a "Datasheet for Datasets" that documents its motivation, composition, collection process, and recommended uses. This increases transparency and helps downstream users understand potential biases.
