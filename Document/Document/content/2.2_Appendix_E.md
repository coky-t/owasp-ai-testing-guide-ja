## 2.2 付録 E: AI コンポーネント脆弱性 (CVE および CWE) への AI 脅威のマッピング (Appendix E: AI Threats Mapping to AI Components Vulnerabilities (CVEs & CWEs))

**AI Penetration Testing Framework: Scoping, CVE/CWE Mapping, and Threat Correlation**

This appendix guides penetration testers on mapping discovered CVEs and CWEs in SAIF components of an AI architecture to AI-specific threats. CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) generally point to specific, documented vulnerabilities in the underlying technology stack, such as libraries, frameworks, or APIs used to build AI systems and applications. CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations), on the other hand, describe classes of software design or implementation flaws that may lead to such vulnerabilities.

**Step 1 — Scoping AI Penetration Tests Within the SAIF Architecture**

Because the pen tests described here target a live AI system/Application, careful scoping is essential: testers must first identify which SAIF components and subcomponents are in scope, enumerate the exact technologies deployed for each, and use that inventory to prioritize CVE/CWE enumeration and threat simulations. In-scope items commonly include components owned or operated by the organization and directly involved in the request→response flow, for example, chat UIs, API backends (e.g., FastAPI), session/orchestration layers, model orchestration frameworks (e.g., LangChain or LlamaIndex), vector stores (Redis, Pinecone, Weaviate), ETL/data pipelines, model-serving endpoints, and internally managed connectors. Because these components can contain outdated, misconfigured, or otherwise exploitable dependencies, the first operational step is threat enumeration: map each in-scope SAIF component to its tech stack, identify relevant CVEs (and corresponding CWEs), and derive likely exploit paths. That mapping then drives focused validation with scanners, SCA tools, and proof-of-concept testing so testers can prioritize, reproduce, and demonstrate how conventional software flaws translate into AI-centric impacts.

**Step 2 — Threat Enumeration and CVE Exploit Path Mapping**

The process of mapping threats to Ai system vulnerabilities starts by identifying known vulnerabilities expressed as CVEs in AI systems/applications using Software composition analyzers (SCAs) and runtime tools. SCA Tools (e.g., Snyk, Trivy, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check, and GitHub Advanced Security) will flag vulnerable third party software dependencies, while scanners such as Nessus and Nuclei can confirm active CVE exposures in APIs and services. Runtime telemetry and host inspection can also validate which CVEs are exploitable in live environments. These CVEs are then mapped to AI-specific threats (i.e. TA0i-XX threats) outlined in this guide: for example, a FastAPI sanitization flaw (CVE-2022-36067) can be part of a prompt-injection vector (T01-DPIJ), and an Airflow ETL vulnerability (CVE-2022-40127) can lead to data poisoning (T01-DMP) in a RAG pipeline.

For each SAIF component in scope, testers review subcomponents, confirm deployed technologies, and run focused tests to find exploitable or unpatched libraries. These findings drive AI-specific attack simulations such as prompt injection, model inversion, data poisoning, or runtime DoS to reveal real application impact. Using the CVE exploit-path mapping table, testers can maintain traceability from vulnerability to AI impact. For instance, Redis in SAIF #4 (Application Layer) vulnerable to CVE-2022-0543 links to risks like data leakage (T01-SID), model disruption (T01-DoSM), and manipulation (T01-MTD). A single Redis compromise can escalate from infrastructure control to model tampering—compromising data integrity, availability, and trust.

**Step 3 — AI Threat-to-CWE Mapping for Root Cause and Remediation**

The final recommended step is to perform AI threat enumeration and CWE exploit-path mapping, transforming vulnerability centric testing into design level assurance. This appendix provides a Threat-to-SAIF-Component-to-CWE mapping, complementing the Threat-to-Test-Case mapping (AITG tests) presented earlier in this guide. Together, these enable testers to link AI-specific vulnerabilities—such as prompt injection, data leakage, or model poisoning—to their root causes, whether insecure design, implementation weakness, or misconfiguration. By classifying findings under CWE categories, testers connect penetration testing results to recognized software weakness patterns. This approach bridges the gap between patch management and secure architecture, guiding fixes that strengthen entire system layers rather than individual components. For example, CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) reveals weak parsing logic; CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) highlights insecure cloud storage defaults; and CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity) exposes trust flaws in RAG ingestion pipelines.

During AITG testing across in-scope SAIF components, each failed test should identify the immediate issue and trace it to a corresponding CWE root cause. Reports should include both the weakness and an actionable recommendation—for instance, enforcing input validation, disabling public defaults, verifying dataset authenticity, or encrypting sensitive data. This shifts the tester’s message from “how I broke it” to “how to fix and redesign it.” As systems evolve, testers can update the CVE and CWE mappings to reflect new vulnerabilities and use the AI Threats column as a living checklist for future red-team exercises. This evolving matrix supports continuous validation and resilience in AI-enabled systems. Once fixes are implemented, corresponding AITG tests should be re-run to verify closure, with findings prioritized by risk severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and resolved per SLA targets. This structured, CWE-driven approach ensures AI testing results are not just diagnostic but actionable, improving both software resilience and long-term AI system risk posture.

## (2) User Input

**Summary:** User Input is the front door of the system, every downstream component depends on it. Without strong input validation, filtering, and limits, it becomes the main vector for prompt injection, data leakage, DoS, and toxicity propagation.

#### Direct Prompt Injection (T01-DPIJ) & Indirect Prompt Injection (T01-IPIJ)

**Mapped CWEs:** [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html), [CWE-74](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html), [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html), [CWE-707](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/707.html)

**Rationale:** Maliciously crafted inputs (user prompts or embedded instructions) can override instructions, alter reasoning chains, or trigger unintended actions in connected tools.

**Recommendations:**
- Apply strict input validation and canonicalization before passing content to the model.  
- Use prompt isolation or sandboxing (separate user and system instructions).  
- Enforce allowlist-based instruction and function patterns.  
- Perform adversarial prompt fuzzing and red-team testing.

#### Denial of Service – Model (T01-DoSM)

**Mapped CWEs:** [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html), [CWE-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html), [CWE-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)

**Rationale:** Oversized, malformed, or adversarial inputs can exhaust tokenization, GPU, or compute capacity, leading to degraded performance or service unavailability.

**Recommendations:**
- Enforce maximum input size and token limits.  
- Apply rate-limits and per-user quotas at API gateways.  
- Use circuit breakers and autoscaling to mitigate load spikes.

#### Insecure Output Handling Triggered by Inputs (T01-IOH)

**Mapped CWEs:** [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html), [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Rationale:** Malicious inputs may propagate into rendered outputs (e.g., HTML, Markdown, or JSON), enabling injection or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Recommendations:**
- Sanitize and contextually encode all rendered outputs.  
- Separate data from control characters; use safe templating and rendering frameworks.  
- Enforce strict content-type validation before presentation.

#### Model Toxicity / Unreliable Outputs (T01-MTU)

**Mapped CWEs:** [CWE-707](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/707.html), [CWE-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html), [CWE-1204](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1204.html)

**Rationale:** Crafted or provocative user inputs can bias model behavior, steering it toward toxic, discriminatory, or ungrounded responses.

**Recommendations:**
- Integrate toxicity and bias classifiers to pre-screen user prompts.  
- Use contextual and sentiment filters on incoming requests.  
- Escalate high-risk or policy-violating cases to human review workflows.

---

## (3) User Output

**Summary:** The last mile to users/connected systems; without control, it’s a vector for excessive agency, prompt leakage, misinformation, and unsafe rendering.

#### Excessive Agency (T01-EA)

**Mapped CWEs:** [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html), [CWE-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)

**Rationale:** Action-bearing model outputs (e.g., generated commands, API calls, workflow triggers) can execute privileged or irreversible operations without authorization or user oversight.

**Recommendations:**
- Enforce least-privilege scopes for all actionable outputs.  
- Apply policy and authorization checks before rendering or executing UI-driven actions.  
- Maintain allowlists and require explicit human approvals for high-impact or sensitive actions.

#### Sensitive Prompt Leakage (T01-SPL)

**Mapped CWEs:** [CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html), [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html), [CWE-359](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/359.html), [CWE-532](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)

**Rationale:** Model outputs, error messages, or logs may inadvertently reveal hidden prompts, credentials, API keys, or personal information embedded in the conversation context.

**Recommendations:**
- Redact secrets, PII, and system instructions prior to rendering or logging.  
- Use structured error wrappers; never expose raw stack traces or backend errors.  
- Segregate user-visible and operator logs; apply DLP scanning to prevent prompt or secret leakage.

#### Misinformation (T01-MIS)

**Mapped CWEs:** [CWE-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html), [CWE-1204](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1204.html)

**Rationale:** Ungrounded, fabricated, or biased statements can appear credible when presented in the UI, eroding user trust or propagating false information.

**Recommendations:**
- Require grounding and citation checks for high-risk or factual claims.  
- Integrate verification confidence scores and “needs review” flags for uncertain responses.  
- Route flagged outputs to human review or moderation pipelines.

#### Insecure Output Handling (T01-IOH)

**Mapped CWEs:** [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html), [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CWE-75](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/75.html)

**Rationale:** Unsanitized model outputs rendered in rich text, HTML, or Markdown can lead to script execution, injection, or UI manipulation in downstream clients.

**Recommendations:**
- Render outputs from structured formats (e.g., JSON, plain text) with context-aware encoding.  
- Sanitize HTML/Markdown through allowlisted elements and attributes.  
- Disable unsafe embeds, links, and inline scripts in all rendering environments.

---
