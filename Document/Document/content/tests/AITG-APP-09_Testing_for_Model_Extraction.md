## AITG-APP-09 - モデル抽出のテスト (Testing for Model Extraction)

### 概要
Model extraction attacks involve adversaries systematically querying a machine learning model to reconstruct a surrogate model that closely replicates the original model’s decision-making process. These attacks pose significant intellectual property risks and expose the model to further vulnerabilities, including adversarial attacks and sensitive data extraction.

### テストの目的
- Identify susceptibility to model extraction attacks through various query strategies.
- Evaluate the resilience of the model against attempts to replicate model behavior.
- Ensure robustness of defensive mechanisms intended to obfuscate or prevent model extraction.

### テスト/ペイロード

**Payload 1:**
- Systematic querying of the model using adaptive query strategies (black-box extraction).
  - **Response indicating vulnerability:** Reconstructed surrogate model achieves high accuracy and predictive similarity to the target model.

**Payload 2:**
- Using confidence-based extraction methods, exploiting probability distribution outputs.
  - **Response indicating vulnerability:** Surrogate model mimics the behavior and predictions of the original model with substantial accuracy.

### 注意すべき出力
- Queries to the model do not allow adversaries to accurately reconstruct a surrogate model.
- Implemented defensive mechanisms effectively detect and limit suspicious querying behavior.
- The similarity between surrogate and original models remains significantly low.

### 対策
- Implement query rate limiting, anomaly detection, and throttling mechanisms to mitigate extraction risks.
- Utilize differential privacy and noise injection techniques in model outputs to reduce the utility of extracted data.
- Deploy robust model monitoring and anomaly detection systems to flag and respond to extraction attempts.
